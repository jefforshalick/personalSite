I was a cofounder and our sole designer at Happy Monday. We developed a job applicant tracking software (ATS) in addition to other tools to support finding a job and hiring for them.

I worked on branding as well as product design. Below is some of my work I did here.

Here is the logo and mark I crafted for our brand.
