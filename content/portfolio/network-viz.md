While at Sift, I reimagined how a sankey diagram displayed data and could be interacted with to give our customers a novel way to visualize their customer networks and gain insights that could help them stop fraudulent activity.

There is styling differences throughout these explanations and the primary mockup. We were in the midst of a design system refresh so needed to keep up with both immediate development and the fast follow up for the refresh.

Clicking the number of connected attributes will hide the users not connected with that attribute so that the users who are connected are isolated in view. You can isolate several attributes at a time for viewing users connected to a group of attributes.

Clicking the 'Show all connections' button will unhide the users that were hidden from isolating on a single attribute.

We also allowed for the pinning of important attributes and the hiding of noisy ones.

Based on customer feedback before and after design and implementation, one of the most important features we improved was bulk actioning. This allowed our customers to decision on more than one of their users in their network based on one or more shared attributes and connections. This saved them lots of time when evaluating their networks.
