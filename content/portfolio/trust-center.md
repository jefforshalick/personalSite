This was a zero to one project with me working with different PM's, developers, and other stakeholders to launch our trust center product. There were three parts to the trust center: the public facing site, the site builder, and the request and monitor amin.
#### Public Facing Site
I went through many itterations for this initial release but landed on a moderatley customizable yet simple offering for our customers to display their security and compliance posture.

#### Site Builder
The site builder allowed users to customize the order of sections, colors, and sections. This was very MVP but still offered enough customization to match the look and feel of your marketing site.

#### Request & Monitor Admin
These two areas gave an admin the ability to manage document requests as well as the linkage between their compliance management in Secureframe and their public trust center page.
